# Todolist

This is a project that I am working on in order to build javascript skills. 
I have no coded in a long time, and I am enjoying getting back into it.
I plan to study Advanced Computing at USYD in 2019 with the aspiration of working
in Frontend and potentially Backend development of websites and the like.
